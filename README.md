# How I Use CLAUDE.md

This is a real example of how I set up a CLAUDE.md file in Claude Code.

~2,000 hours in. 10 months. The single biggest thing I've learned: a <200-line CLAUDE.md determines more of my output quality than the model does. Everyone focuses on the model. The leverage is in the layer you build around it.

## What's in this repo

`CLAUDE.md` — An example of a working project file. Not a template with blanks. A real structure showing how I set up every project I work on.

## The mentality

Claude Code isn't a coding tool. I run clients, content, outreach, and project management through it. Once you see it as an operating system instead of a code assistant, the use cases open up.

The CLAUDE.md is the core of that. It loads automatically every session. The AI reads it before doing anything. Zero re-onboarding, zero re-explaining.

## This is a living document

The example here is a snapshot. My real ones change constantly. Every time I correct the AI, that correction goes into the file so it doesn't repeat it. After a few weeks, first drafts need a light touch instead of a rewrite. The system gets better without me repeating myself.

**How to start:** 10 lines on your next project. What it does, how it's structured, what you care about. Then every time you correct the AI, add that correction. After 3-4 projects you'll have a setup that feels like working with someone who already knows how you build.

## What makes this different

Most people write CLAUDE.md files like config files. Here's my stack, here's my linter, here's my folder structure. That's fine, but it's the least interesting part.

The sections that actually move the needle:

- **"How We Work Together"** — Sets the relationship, not just the task. Permission to push back, flag uncertainty, plan before acting. This changes how the AI operates
- **Session protocol** — Start and end rituals that give it continuity across sessions
- **"This File Is Alive"** — Telling the AI this file changes. It's not a static reference, it's a compounding correction log
- **Preferences** — Not just code style. How you think, how you communicate, what annoys you
- **Guardrails** — What it should never do without asking. Non-negotiable boundaries

## Context

I'm Simon Bergeron. I spend most of my time in Claude Code running multi-agent setups. Two things I'm building:

**VerifiedNode** — Two-person company, 58K+ contractor records. Trust layer for the agentic web.

**Lemonbrand** — My personal brand. Teaching people how I actually work with agents, building a course around the method, consulting for clients who want custom tools built with this stuff.

The system reviews the output. I review the system.
